# "Follow me" application on a NAO robot
In this project I implemented “Follow Me” application on a NAO robot by using Python NaoQi. 

## Requirements
* Windows 10
* Python 2.7.18 (Important!)
* Choregraphe
* NAOqi Python

## Open Choregraphe
Open Choregraphe software and click on `Connect > Connect to` in order to observe your `IP` and `Port`

## Run script
Open your terminal and change direction to your script location. After that you need to write `python 'file_name.py'` and observe results in Choregraphe software.
